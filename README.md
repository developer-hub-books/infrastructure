# Infrastructure Guide

NOTE: This document is a work in progress!

## Reproducing the Example Solutions 
Unfortunately, a complete guide to establishing your own infrastructure for the cited examples from [Developer Portals: Prepare to Perform with Red Hat Developer Hub](https://developers.redhat.com/e-books/developer-portals) is not available at this time.  We plan to offer more details about setting up your own infrastructure in the coming months.

* If you already have existing infrastructure ready to go, please refer to Chapter 3 for information about [installing the provided templates](https://github.com/developer-hub-books/rhdh-book1-templates)
* Red Hat employees and partners may be able to access suitable infrastructure via the [Red Hat Demo Portal](https://demo.redhat.com)

Meanwhile, the following alternatives may help you establish suitable infrastructure for completing the included exercises:

* Sign up for a 60 day trial of Red Hat Developer Hub:

* Find the authors at a conference near you for a hands-on workshop experience
* Contact the authors to request a virtual workshop experience for your team
